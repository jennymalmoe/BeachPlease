# UX

### User stories

As a first time visitor I want to:  

* learn about the studio so I can make a decision whether to be member or not. Does the studios serveces offers what I want and need. 
* be able to easily navigate and find general information about prices, location, classes etc.
* get a wow impression of the studio. Does it seem like a credible and inspiring place to me? Is it valuble enough for me, as a user, to stay and explore the studio site, and possibly even return?
* be able to get a free trial period to make a decision to buy a membership or not. It's common practice for studios to offer a free trial period. I might choose another studio if this one doensn't offer that.
* find out how this studio stands out from the crowd (the studios USP's *better results in less time and remote training*), why should I choose "Absolute Fitness" instead of someone else? 

As a returning visitor (existing member, potential member with training experience, potential member with no training experience) I want to:

* find schedules, contact information and current events.
* be able to easily navigate and find general information about prices, location, classes etc.
* be presented with an attractive membership offer and/or a free trial. I need that to make a decision if this is something for me (especially returning visitors with no training exprerience).  
* find out how this studio stands out from the crowd (the studios USP:s - better results in less time and remote training), why should I choose "Absolute Fitness" instead of someone else? 
* be asured that this traing method is compateble to me. I don't want to buy a membership, and then find out it's out of my leauge.



## Strategy

### Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to *"Build a website for a gym. ...Build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.
Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service."*
(*Code Institute Assessment Handbook*)

### Business Goals

The business goal of the website is to increase the number of members (increase sales) and keep existing members by having an appealing site. This is "Absolute Fitness" fist website. 

Target audience: Women age 18-65 in the local area (as well as all over geographically, due to the studios remote classes) with limited time resources and women who want to maximize training results in less time than average workouts.


### User Goals

Customer goals of the website is to get information about the studio and get a get a good idea of what it offers. Just as important is the feel the visitor gets about the sites/studios identity. It also allows the customer to take part of an offer. Lastly the costumer will see a professional and inspiring website with a mobile-first approach.


## Scope 

### User Requirements and Expectation

* The site is designed to signal energy, high end and modern.  

* CTA - call to action. The free trial button should draw user's attention immediatle (without the need to scroll) and gives the user the opportunity to try out the serveces. 

* An attractive and brief discription of the studios classes. 

* Schedule.

* Prices.

* Covid alert banner. Points out the studios high level of sanitation service to make members feel safe. The alert is easy to change to current offers/event etc.

* Contact information and opening hours. 

* Social medialinks.

## Structure

The website is designed to be consistent and intuitive, but at the same time eye catching. The most importent content is presented in the home page (offer and call to action as well). The business name is placed top-left corner, since users tend to read/look top-left corner moves down and right from there. 
 
The site consists of four pages. A header that includes business name and a navigation bar and a footer with social media links will be consistent troughout all pages. 

The site focuses on the offer and aims to attract their targetgroup by the style and images. Thats the fist thing a visitor sees. Then the goal is to visit the navlinks in the order they are set. Next step should be "Classes" where the visitor hopefully gets really interested and wants to be a member. Next step presents prices, that makes the vistor even more close to a decision. And lastly some contactinformation and the opportunity to contact the studio.

The information is briefly presented, there isn't not too much information, just enough to make the visitor interested. The visitor will not feel overwhelming (so the user doesn't leave the site and look for another site).

## Surface

### Design Choices

**Colorscheme**
The site represents highend and feminine values, with a clear message, and offer. The colors are soft, warm, inviting, encouraging, and modern. Characteristics that attract women. I added some accent colors (bright yellow and turquoise) that are used for emphasis my color scheme. These accent colors are bold and vivid and are used spairingly to create an eye catcing moment (used on call to actions buttons and alert bar foremost). 

![color_scheme](assets/images/color_scheme.png)

**Typography**

MSP2: Meddon, Source Sans Pro. The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the site with Sans-serif as the fallback font. Roboto was developed to balance content density and reading comfort and is pretty subtle, it doesn´t take any attention away from the content. The site has focused to get the visitors attention by powerful headlines. If the headline hooks the visitor, they tend to continue to read the body, if it doesn't they’ll leave. The headline is catchy, in bigger and bolder font, short, inspiring and get the visitor emotionally engaged.  


**Imagery**

The sites images are all striking and modern. Most images is of women in a stylish and in a positive environment. 

**Icons**

Icons used at the first page to set the tone for the sites design approach.

### Features left to implement

On the home/hisory page, I'd like to create a quiz that the user can take part in to test their knowledge about Cornwall after reading the 'Beginner's Guide To Cornwall'.

Display a clickable icon as a link to a forum page where the user can dicsuss Cornwall further with other friendly visitors.

Gallery Page - A seperate page to showcase images of Cornwall and visitors' experiences of the range of activities, beach walks etc. on offer. This would give the user a more concrete idea of what to expect from a visit to Cornwall.

Include more markers and information to give the user an even more extensive view of what Cornwall has to offer.

On the scroll of the page, the hero image would zoom in.

## Testing

!!!However, the documentation is quite brief lacking necessary sections for the development life cycle such as testing and features for future release.

First time testing. I used an online tool called Lambdatest and the chromium dev tools for testing. I made an spreadsheet containing test results. You can find this here.

Ive tested the CSS with CSS Validator which told me that all was good.

The HTML ive tested with HTML Validator which gave me the following results:

Warning:

Navbar section lacks heading
Errors:

Attribute a not allowed on element a at this poin
Possible misuse of aria-label
Fixes:

Changed section to div
Remove a Attribute
Moved aria-label to correct position
Responsiveness

Implementation Ive used Bootstrap throughout the project to ensure maximum responsibility. Ive tested with devtools and Lambdatest.

Results Responsiveness was as to be expected, except for the navbar, which didnt collapse on click, which in turn, covered a big portion of the content. I was not happy. Luckily my mentor gave me a JavaScript script, which solved the problem!

Verdict After resolving the navbar issue, everything is responsive and the test has passed.

Design

Implementation The design of the site was based on the design of the Horizon Zero Dawn website, using 'look-a-like' fonts, as the fonts used are custom for them. I used some of the colors and styles for a sense of familiarity for people who know the game and would attract people who dont know the game yet.

Results I feel the use of fonts and colors really add up to the content and make for a well balanced whole. I did change the opacity of the jumbotrons as some people told me the text was hard to read.

Verdict Everything is working and looks good. So this test has passed.

Contact form

Implementation The contactform is used to contact the site owner. I got this form from the Bootstrap site and customized it to my own needs. Form validation was implemented at the same time, so users need to put in a value into every form field, before being able to push the Send button. As of now it is not possible to send the form, so for the time being there is no feedback.

Results The contactform is working as intended, formfields are validated.

Verdict Form validation works, so test passed.

!!!Missing out on functional testing details and user story testing. 
The testing needs to be done in a stepwise and detailed manner in terms of -
Give it a step by step format eg.
Expected -Site is expected to do X why the user does Y
Testing - Tested the site by doing Y
Result - The site did not respond due to A,B,C
or
Result - The site acted as normally and it did Y
Fix - I did Z to the code because something was missing
Please refer to the Sample Readme -  https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME
The README describes the testing process very briefly with only testing outcome pictures presented and the bugs are reported at a quite high level without details either. However, it is unknown that how the testing is conducted. It is suggested to include testing details and report related bugs/issues.

I've been using W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, Lighthouse and Am I responsive to test and check my project;

![Lighthouse_mobile.png](assets/images/Lighthouse_mobile.png) 
![Lighthouse_desktop.png](assets/images/Lighthouse_desktop.png) 
![mockup.png](assets/images/mockup.png)

I've been testing site (friend as well) on different browsers, Chrome, Safari and on differnt devices. 


## Bugs
Here are some I encountered, with the solution.

During development

Jumbotron overflow:
Removed margins and padding and added height in media query.
Columns not nicely spaced:
Set margins on top and bottoms.
Anchor link about ID not jumping to right place:
Still figuring that one out.
Rows to close to each other:
Set margins and padding.
Content not centering on mobile:
Set margin and padding.
From validation/testing

Nav section didnt have a heading, got flagged by html validator.
Changed section tag for div, as nav doesnt need a heading per se.
Double a tag on lines with links:
Removed a from target tag.
Possible misuse of aria-label:
Moved aria-label and rel from the i tag to the a tag, where they belong.
Navbar links not collapsing on click on mobile:
Trying some js for this.
From peer code review

Overflow:
Changed margins and padding on multiple elements and removed hover effect on img to prevent overflow.
Navbar not hiding on click:
js fixed the job :)
Changed opacity on jumbotrons as some people found it hard to read.
Images with hover effect where overlapping a bit.
Reduced the size of the hover.

## Deployment 
This project is deployed using GitHub Pages. This is how I deployed my GitHub Repository via GitHub Pages:

1. In GitHub select "Your Repositories".
2. Select the repository you want to deploy.
3. Click "Settings" in the top horizontal menu.
4. Inside the "Settings" page scroll down and locate the GitHub Pages headline.
5. Click the link; "Check it out here!".
6. Make sure the branch is set to "Master" then click "Save".
7. Just over the save button you will see that your site is ready to be published and a link will be presented: "Your site is published at https://....." 

Forking the GitHub Repository:
You can fork a GitHub Repository to make a copy of the original repository. You can make changes and review this copy without it affects the original repository. 
Find the repository, click the fork button (top right corner, under your account), you now have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. 

Make a local clone: 
Find the repository, click "Code" button, copy the link shown, in Gitpod, change the directory to the location you would like the cloned directory to be located, type "git clone" and paste the link you earlier copied, press enter.
