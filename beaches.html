                        <p class="card-text">The silky white sands of Sandhammaren match the best beaches of the Mediterranean. It’s been voted as Sweden’s best beach several times. Laze around around on white, powdery sand, take a dip in the sea, or enjoy a beach walk that goes for miles. The location of the beach are conducive to some pumping ocean breaks drawing surfers from all over the globe. In need for a breathtaking getaway? This is the place to be! </p>
                        <p>It’s the perfect place for sipping cocktails, bathing on hot summer days, or just walking along the dunes and inland pine forests in any season. Sandhammaren is at the southernmost point of Sweden, so currents can be dangerous. Be careful when you swim here – maybe walk out and swim back? Parking spaces can be hard to find if you come on the busiest days in the summer. After sunbathing and swimming, then take a walk through the nature reserve that has a wealth of wildlife, as well as Sweden’s most southerly elk population! Just north of the beach.

                        <p class="card-text">What makes Knäbäckshusens Strand so popular and one of the most beautiful beaches in the southern Swedish province of Skåne is its special location and atmosphere. It is situated at the foot of a high dune belt, which is forested with dense pine trees all the way down to the beach. This creates a feeling of seclusion as well as an almost exotic flair due to the trees that grow right down to the beach and partly reach out to the water.
                            The range of activities including snorkelling, kayaking, wildlife spotting and hiking make it a well rounded beach appealing to a variety of people. Knäbäckshusens Strand consists of almost white fine-grained sand and stretches for more than three kilometres from the fishing village of Vik in the south to the border of Stenshuvuds Nationalpark in the north, where the beach line merges seamlessly into Stenshuvuds Strand. The golden sands and pristine waters make it an ideal swimming spot for families.</p>
                        <p>Knäbäckshusen is the standout among the many breathtaking beaches of Skåne. First time visitors are regularly speechless when they try to describe its beauty and it's not hard to see why. Knäbäckshusen beach is famous for its untouched stretch of shoreline and lapping turquoise waters. It gives you a wonderful Mediterranean feel.
