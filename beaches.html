It is situated at the foot of a high dune belt, which is forested with dense pine trees all the way down to the beach. This creates a feeling of seclusion as well as an almost exotic flair due to the trees that grow right down to the beach and partly reach out to the water.
                    In the immediate vicinity of the shore line the beach is gravelly and in the water there are some larger boulders on the otherwise sandy seabed. The shore is very shallow and you have to walk quite far into the sea to swim.
